# photomap-gallery
Native html, css, javascript and php photo gallery/ map for geotagged photos.

Example at jamesrunnalls.com/photogallery.html

Instructions for use:

1) Upload all files and folders to server
2) Add you geotagged photos to the "photos" folder (most phones geotag automatically if not you can geotag photos online)
3) Open the photos.php link in order to run this file. This creates a photos.xml file that contains the photos information and creates a smaller copy of the image for faster page loading. 
4) Enjoy

P.s. If you want to streamline the upload process you can use AndFTP (on andriod) in order to easly upload photos from your phone to the "photos" folder.
